# TuxGuitar 1.3.1 fork
## This is a fork of TuxGuitar 1.3.1 used for my own personal experimentation with the application.

#Planned features:
- Make copy/clean/delete measures a bit faster by allowing the user to type in numbers instantly
- Add a dropdown to stringed instruments to change to common tunings faster
- Add a tool to convert drum kicks to guitar breakdowns
