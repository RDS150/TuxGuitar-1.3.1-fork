# TuxGuitar 1.3.1 fork

This is a fork of TuxGuitar 1.3.1 used for my own personal experimentation with the application.

##Original source:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/
TuxGuitar was made by Julian Casadesus (akdmia) and other Authors specified in the included AUTHORS file, taken from the original source

##Features:
- Brings back the Note Duration toolbar!
- Makes the ability to copy/clean/delete measures a bit faster by allowing the user to type in numbers instantly (by removing the checks from the bottom spinner)
- Added a dropdown to stringed instruments to change to common tunings faster

##Planned features:
- Add a tool to convert drum kicks to guitar breakdowns 

Original Readme, License, Authors, Changes files included for clarity. The original-source suffix is used where necessary

This fork was created by Theo Kyriazidis.
